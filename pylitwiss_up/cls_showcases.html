					‚ÄúThe British novel, from 1740 to 1850. Peripheral, often despised at the beginning of the period, by its end the novel has moved very close to the core of the national culture. So, this is an important century, for this literary form

					‚ÄúI focus on three moments of this history: first, I describe a <b>major metamorphosis</b> of eighteenth-century titles, and try to explain its causes; next, I suggest how a <b>new type of title</b> that emerged around 1800 may have changed what readers expected of novels; and finally, I make a little attempt at quantitative stylistics, examining some <b>strategies by which titles point to specific genres</b>‚Äù.

				<p>‚ÄúToday, this sounds odd; but actually, a <b>summary at the beginning of a novel makes sense</b>: a novel is a narrative, and the title ‚Äî the title-page, here one sees why books needed a whole page for their title ‚Äî the title-as-summary was a <b>shorter narrative</b>: it presented the main events of the story, the characters, the setting, the ending.

				<p style="font-size:80%">‚Äú<...> the cultural ecosystem was changing in a way that was incompatible with it: in the course of the eighteenth century, the publication of novels in Britain grew dramatically‚Äù</p>
				<img data-src="pics/fig7.png" height="400">
				</section>
				<section>
				<p>‚Äú<...> as the number of new novels kept increasing, each of them had inevitably a much <b>smaller ‚Äòwindow‚Äô of visibility</b> on the market, and it became vital for a title to catch quickly and effectively the eye of the public. Summaries were not good at that‚Äù</p>

				<h3>Zus√§tzlich der Aufstieg von Zeitschriften</h3>
				<img data-src="pics/montlhy.png" height="400">
				</section>
				<section>
				<p>‚ÄúIn the third, and even more so in the fourth quarter of the eighteenth century, <b>the Monthly and other magazines started to publish reviews</b> of many new novels, making title-page summaries somewhat superfluous: as the literary system grew, in other words, some of its <b>functions became more specialized</b>, ‚Äòfreeing‚Äô titles from having to provide a detailed description.‚Äù</p>

				<h2>Moment II. Die Arten der Kurztitel</h2>
				</section>
				<section>
				<p style="font-size:90%">How can a couple of words stand in for hundreds of pages? What does it mean, that they should do so? For summaries, it‚Äôs clear: they are scaled-down versions of the whole story. Two words? So, I started looking at these short titles, and found three main clusters within the group: <b>proper names</b> (Octavia; George Barnwell), which make up around one-third of the total; the <b>article-noun</b> (The Steam-Boat; The Smuggler) and <b>article-adjective-noun</b> combinations (The Tuscan Vase; The Invisible Gentleman) just below 30 per cent; and <b>conceptual abstractions</b> (Fatality; Enthusiasm not Religion) around 10 per cent.</p>

				<img data-src="pics/fig11.png" height="400">
				</section>
				<section>
				<p style="font-size:80%">In the <b>article-noun combination</b>, half of the titles describing a social type evoke an <b>exotic-transgressive field</b>‚ÄîThe Fakeer, The Vampyre, The Fire-eater, The Pirate, The Sabbath-Breaker, The Spectre, The Rebel, The Epicurean, The Mussulman, The Libertine, The Parricide . . . ‚Äîand only a small minority evokes the idea of the ‚Äòfamiliar‚Äô (wife, brother, father, daughter, etc.). But <b>when an adjective is added</b> to the title, the ratio is exactly reversed (Figure 11, overleaf): fakeers and libertines drop from 50 to 20 per cent, while <b>wives and daughters</b> rise from 16 to 40 per cent: The Unfashionable Wife, The Discarded Daughter, The Infidel Father, The Rival Brothers, The Posthumous Daughter, The False Friend, The Maniac Father . . . <span class="fragment"><b>Without adjectives, we are in a world of adventures; with adjectives, in a destabilized domesticity.</b></span></p>

				<h3>Frauen erlangen Nachnamen und sozialen Status (zur√ºck)</h3>
				</section>

				<section>
				<p style="font-size:90%">‚ÄúLucy, Caroline, Belinda, Emma . . . <b>Heroines who lack a last name</b>: a very simple, very crude hint, typical of the British marriage plot (which reaches its apex in these decades): they <b>lack a husband</b>. But the wider field charted in Figures 13 through 16 also shows how quickly the <b>gender asymmetry was reversed</b> in the 1820s and ‚Äô30s, and how frequent the heroine‚Äôs last name could actually be. </p>
				</section>

				<section>
				<img data-src="pics/womensurnames.png" height="500">
				</section>
				 
				<section>
				<p style="font-size:90%">‚Äú<...>the main changes were almost certainly caused by shifts in the system of genres: the historical novel‚Äôs rise to prominence after 1815, for instance, with its mostly male heroes; or the marriage plot becoming embedded within genres like the Bildungsroman and the industrial novel, where the <b>heroine acquired a public life</b>, which was promptly mirrored in titles like Jane Eyre or Mary Barton. Again, see how much can be done with how little, in short titles: one word, and the image of the heroine rotates 180 degrees: from private, to public‚Äù. </p>

				<h3>Moment III. Eine genrespezifische Titelstruktur: the X of Y</h3>
				</section>

				<section>
				<p><...>a formula that, at first sight, looks as flat and uninspiring as could be: <b>The Duchess of York, The Novice of Corpus Domini, The Heir of Montgomery Castle</b> <span class="fragment">:let‚Äôs call it the <b>x of y.</b></span>
				</p>
				</section>
				<section>
				<img data-src="pics/xofy1.png">
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>
						‚Äúthe formula has <b>always been quite frequent in titles</b>, never dropping below 10 per cent of the total; but around 1800 its frequency increases, and if we look more closely at those decades, we find that the surge does not occur evenly everywhere, but is almost entirely concentrated in a <b>single genre, which is the gothic</b>. There, ‚Äòthe x of y‚Äô appears three times more often than in the rest of the corpus‚Äù
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
				<img data-src="pics/xofy2.png">
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>
						if we look at the <b>x</b> in the formula, we find that <b>romance</b> appears in 7 percent of the cases (The Romance of the Pyrenees), a cluster of genre indicators like <b>mysteries, horrors, secrets, adventures</b> in 13 percent (The Horrors of Oakendale Abbey), <b>personal nouns</b> in 34 percent (Emmeline, or the Orphan of the Castle), and <b>space nouns</b> in 41 percent of the total (fig. 20): from The Castle of Otranto in 1764 to The Mines of Wielitzka and The Rock of Glotzden a half century later. So, in three fourths of the cases the x of y specifies an x that is either a person or a space.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
				<img data-src="pics/xofy3.png">
				</section>

				<section>
					<p>
					And when we move from the subject of the formula to its predicate ‚Äî from the x to the y ‚Äî what we find is so striking that I don‚Äôt even need a graph to point it out: The Romance of the Pyrenees, The Horrors of Oakendale Abbey, The Orphan of the Castle, The Castle of Otranto, The Mines of Wielitzka, The Rock of Glotzden . . . in 82 percent of the cases, the y is a space: a person defined by a space, or, most frequent of all, a space defined by another space.
